# Simple NFT Demo

## Intro
This CodeLab shows a very simple implementation of NFT minting. The project does not include functionality for payment transactions or an UI, but the functionality can be tested through the Candid interface.<br><br>The project has the following functionality:

- Minting a NFT
- Transfer ownership
- Checking ownership of a NFT

Other features like payment, approvals and file uploads will be covered in future CodeLabs, as an extension of this project.

## Before you begin
Before you start this tutorial, verify the following:
* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local macOS or Linux computer.
* You have node.js installed if you want to include the default template files for front-end development in your project.
* You have downloaded and installed the DFINITY Canister SDK package as described in Download and install.
* You have installed the Visual Studio Code plugin for Motoko as described in Install the language editor plug-in if you are using Visual Studio Code as your IDE.
* You have stopped any Internet Computer network processes running on the local computer.

## NFT Metadata
This project is *inspired* by the ERC721 token standard, and the standard's metadata format is being used. The functions are not strictly following the ERC721 standard.

**Metadata format:**
```
{
    "title": "Asset Metadata",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Identifies the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Describes the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "image": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this NFT represents. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive."
        }
    }
}
```
